# Welcome

I am an [IVADO](https://ivado.ca/en/) professor in the [Department of Decision Sciences](https://www.hec.ca/mqg/index.html) at [HEC Montréal](https://www.hec.ca/en/). Trained in quantitative methods for finance, I have a keen interest in asset allocation, risk management, and text-mining. In 2018, the Swiss Risk Association awarded me "Swiss risk manager of the year". I am  a big fan of open-source coding and co-authored several R packages such as [AdMit](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=AdMit), [bayesGARCH](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=bayesGARCH), [DEoptim](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=DEoptim), [GAS](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=GAS), [MSGARCH](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=MSGARCH), [RiskPortfolios](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RiskPortfolios), [PeerPerformance](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=PeerPerformance), and [sentometrics](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sentometrics). I recently developed the [COVID19 Data Hub](https://covid19datahub.io) project. I am also a founding member of the [Sentometrics](https://www.sentometrics.org/) organization, a member of [Fin-ML](https://fin-ml.ca/) and [Quantact](http://quantact.uqam.ca/), and an instructor at [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/financial-analytics-in-spreadsheets). When I'm not coding, I play a _foodie_ in downtown Montréal. 

Most research papers and publications are available 
on [SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=372409) and the book "Financial Risk Management with Bayesian Estimation of GARCH Models" can be ordered from [Springer](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-78657-3).
